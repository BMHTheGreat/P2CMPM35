The Zoomable Icicle interaction inspired us to create something that changes in size depending on user reaction.
We all were familiar and fond of Genshin Impact, a gacha game that had come out recently, and thus wanted to incorporate Claudia's data to create an interactable day-to-day enjoyment playing mobile Gacha games vs. established RPGs.

We decided it would be more efficient (and easier to understand for the viewer) to set it up as a bar graph like this example though.

We attempted to create more interaction for when you moused over each rectangle. Text was supposed to appear showing the "Fun" value of each game session, but could not get the value from the CSV to show up as anything other than "undefined".
