The Zoomable Icicle interaction inspired us to create something that changes in size depending on user reaction.
We all were familiar and fond of Genshin Impact, a gacha game that had come out recently, and thus wanted to incorporate Claudia's data to create an interactable day-to-day enjoyment playing mobile Gacha games vs. established RPGs.

We decided it would be more efficient (and easier to understand for the viewer) to set it up as a bar graph like this example though.
